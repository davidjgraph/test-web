If you want to delete a shape and all of the connections to and from that shape, you can do that with a keyboard + toolbar shortcut.

1. Select the shape you want to delete.
2. Hold down the ``Shift`` key and click on the delete (trash can) icon in the toolbar.

Now, your shape and all of its connections will be deleted.

**Note:** When you have selected a shape, press the ``Backspace`` or ``Delete`` key to delete only the shape. Follow the steps above if you want to delete the shape and its connections at the same time.
