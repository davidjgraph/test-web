You can store and collaborate on diagrams using your company's shared drives in G Suite, previously known as Google Team Drives, in the same way as you can use your personal Google Drive with diagrams.net.

## Use Google shared drives with didagrams.net

1. Go to [app.diagrams.net](http://app.diagrams.net). Select Google Drive as the location to which you want to save your diagrams to. If you don't see Google Drive as an option, click on the _Change storage_ link.

2. Follow the prompts to authorise diagrams.net (draw.io) to access your Google Drive and grant permission to the app to store and read files.
   - Click on _Authorize_ and log in with your company Google account.

Once you have finished granting access to your Google Drive, click on _Create New Diagram_ to start diagramming immediately, using your Google shared drive as the storage location.
