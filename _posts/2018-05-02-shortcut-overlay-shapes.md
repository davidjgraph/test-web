When you work with container shapes, dropping a shape over that container inserts that shape into that container. While this is useful for adding steps to a flow chart inside a flow lane (e.g. using the flow layout shape), you may not necessarily want to add the shape for the person responsible into the flow lane container, but instead overlay it.

## How to overlay a shapes

1. Select and drag your shape to a position over a container shape.
2. Press and hold the ``Alt`` key on Windows or the ``Option`` key on MacOS, then release the mouse button. You'll notice that the purple outline disappears when you press the key - this indicates that the shape you are holding won't be added to the container.

Depending on the order in which you added these shapes to your diagram, the shape you moved may be arranged in front of or behind the container shape. You can change this order in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel: select a shape, then click either _To Front_ or _To Back_ to bring the shape to the front or send it behind the other shapes.

**Note**: Overlaying shapes does not group them. If you want to be able to move them as a group, select the container shape and the overlaid shape, right-click and select _group_.
