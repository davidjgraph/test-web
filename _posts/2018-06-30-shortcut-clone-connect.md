You can quickly build flow charts, mind maps or tree diagrams using shortcut key combinations.

To clone and connect shapes, press and hold the ``Alt`` and ``Shift`` keys, and then tap an ``Arrow key`` to clone and automatically connect a shape in that direction (``Option``+``Shift``+``Arrow key`` under MacOS).

Should you tap in a direction where a shape exists, the shape won't be cloned, but a connector will simply be attached in that direction.
