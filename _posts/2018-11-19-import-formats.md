As diagrams.net aims to become the de facto diagramming tool, used by everyone around the world, it's important to be able to import from a variety of file formats and from a number of storage locations.

Of course, we are always looking to expand the import formats and storage platforms that diagrams.net supports.

## diagrams.net import formats

Right now, you can import diagrams and components in the following file formats:

- .drawio (the diagram format used by diagrams.net)
- Gliffy diagram files
- .vsdx and .vsd diagram files
- Lucidchart diagram files
- PNG image files (with or without the embedded XML of a .drawio diagram)
- SVG images
- JPEG images

Plus using the text-based import tools (_Arrange > Insert > ..._) you can create diagrams using:
- SQL code
- CSV data (you'll need to describe how to translate that into a diagram)
- Text
- PlantUML code
- Freehand drawing

**Note:** Some of these text-based input methods are only available at diagrams.net online.

If you are using the draw.io app for Atlassian Confluence, you can even convert _all_ of your Gliffy diagrams in your Confluence instance to .drawio diagrams in just a few clicks using the automated draw.io Gliffy mass import tool.

## Import diagrams from these sources

diagrams.net works with diagrams and images stored at a number of locations.

- Local storage: in-browser only, or stored on your local hard drive (desktop or mobile).
- Cloud platforms: Google Drive, OneDrive, NextCloud, and Dropbox.
- Github and GitLab.

And because diagrams.net is open source, there is an ever-increasing ecosystem of diagrams.net integrations which support even more storage locations and applications!
