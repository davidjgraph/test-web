Quickly move an entire of your diagram: hold down the ``Control`` and ``Shift`` keys, then click on a blank section of the drawing canvas and drag to move it. You'll see guide lines appear to show you the origin and displacement of the area you are moving.

Any shapes that are fully inside the area you move will move to match how far you dragged the canvas. If these shapes were connected, their connectors will reroute automatically.

## Keep multiple shapes aligned

It doesn't matter whether the shapes in that area are selected or not, or grouped or not. Any shapes entirely on one side of the guide lines will be moved. This is a convenient way to rearrange the shapes in your diagram quickly and neatly.

The move area shortcut (previously known as the _scissors tool_) is especially useful for floor plans, BPMN diagrams or any diagrams with well defined and aligned sections.

**Note:** The ``Ctrl+Shift+drag`` shortcut doesn't work if you start dragging over a shape - make sure you start dragging on a blank section of the drawing canvas.
