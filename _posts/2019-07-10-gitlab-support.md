You can store your diagrams in GitLab after authorising access to your account and repositories - diagrams.net will never see your GitLab password.

## Diagram on GitLab

1. Click on the following link: [https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=gitlab](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=gitlab)
2. To open a file, click on _Open Existing Diagram_. Alternatively, create a new diagram and give it a file name.

3. If you haven't previously connected to GitLab, you'll need to grant permission to access your account and repositories. Click on _Authorize_.

4. You'll be redirected to the GitLab website. Sign in to your account on GitLab. Click on  _Authorize_ when prompted by GitLab.

4. Navigate to the file you want to open and click on it. Or navigate to the location where you want to save your new diagram, and click _OK_.

If you sign out of your account while editing a diagram stored in GitLab (via your username in the top right of the diagram editor), it will immediately close the diagram and return you to the initial screen where you'll have to authorise access to your account again.

## Revoke access to your GitLab account

1. Go to your user settings in GitLab - click on your profile image in the top right, then on _Settings_.
2. Go to the _Applications_ section on the left, and scroll down to the bottom.
3. Click on the red _Revoke_ button to the right of the application to deauthorise access to your GitLab account.
