DESKTOP VERSIONS PRE 10.7.5 ARE STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL A NEW DESKTOP BUILD
{: .alert .alert-danger}

Desktop versions prior to 10.7.5 have a critical security flaw, so we’re disabling them all, sorry. To resolve, just go to the diagrams.net desktop project on Github, [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases), and download the latest version for your platform. Once that’s installed, you’re good to go again.

Versions of desktop from 10.7.5 run completely isolated from the Internet, so the security hole can’t reappear.
