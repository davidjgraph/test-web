The free [diagrams.net add-on for Google Docs](https://gsuite.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/drawio_diagrams_for_docs/224440279306?hl=en&pann=docs_addon_widget) lets you embed your diagrams into your documents. When the diagram files have been updated via your Google Drive, all you need to do is update them inside your document to show those changes.

## Install the diagrams.net Google Docs add-on

1. Open a document, or create a new document. Click _Add-ons > Get Add-ons_.
2. Search for diagrams and click on [_draw.io Diagrams for Docs_](https://gsuite.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/drawio_diagrams_for_docs/224440279306?hl=en&pann=docs_addon_widget).

4. Once the diagrams.net add-on has been successfully installed, you can start using it via the _Add-ons > draw.io Diagrams for Docs_ submenu.

Note that your diagram data is only ever stored in your browser and on your Google Drive account.

## Using diagrams in Google Docs

You don't need to export an image from your diagram to paste into the Google Doc - use the add-on to embed the diagram file directly into your document.

**Tip:** Make sure you allow pop-ups in your browser. When you create a new diagram, this will open a new tab or window in your browser and go to diagrams.net. When you save your diagram, make sure you save it to your Google Drive.

### Embed a diagram in a Google doc

1. Click _Add-ons > draw.io Diagrams for Docs > New Diagram_ to create a new diagram, which is saved to your Google Drive. You may need to [grant additional permissions to diagrams.net to use your Google Drive account](/doc/faq/addon-google-scope.html).
2. When you want to embed an existing diagram, including a new diagram you have created and saved to your Google Drive, click _Add-ons > draw.io Diagrams for Docs > Insert Diagrams_. Select multiple diagrams by holding down ``Shift`` when you click on each diagram file.
3. Navigate to your diagram file, select it, then click _Select_.

**Crop your diagram:** Select a diagram, click the _Crop Image_ tool in the toolbar, then drag the black borders that appear on your selected diagram to crop it. Note that this only crops how the diagram is displayed in your document, it does not change your diagram file.

**Reposition your diagram:** Drag the diagram to the right or the left to reposition it within your document.

**Recolour the diagram:** Select a diagram, then click _Image options_ in the toolbar. Click the _Re-color_ dropdown and apply a colour filter. This only changes how your diagram is displayed in your document, it does not change your diagram file.

### Update the embedded diagrams to see changes

Your diagram is displayed as an image inside your Google Document. If you make changes to the diagram file stored in your Google Drive, you'll need to regenerate the images to see those changes inside your document.

1. Select the diagram inside your Google Document.
2. Click _Add-ons > draw.io Diagrams for Docs > Update Selected_.

If you want to update all of the diagrams, click _Add-ons > draw.io Diagrams for Docs > Update All_.
