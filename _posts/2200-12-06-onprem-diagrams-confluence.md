With the rising popularity of cloud collaboration, it is not surprising that some diagramming software providers are exiting the on-premises market. You don't have to worry about that with draw.io.

Lucidchart has recently announced that they will begin sunsetting ('kill' or 'cancel' to the rest of us) their Confluence Server and Data Center apps, Lucidchart OnPrem, starting from 6 January 2020. After this date, customers will be encouraged to move their diagrams to Lucidchart's own cloud platform, and use a connector app in Confluence to embed Lucidchart diagrams. The on-prem app will be fully deprecated one year later, on 6 January 2021, when they will stop supporting Confluence 7.5 and require customers to migrate their diagrams.

## Bad for companies who require on-premise data storage

While much is being made of their 'industry-leading security' (have you noticed how everyone is 'industry leading' ...), many companies who are currently use the Lucidchart apps within their on-premises Confluence infrastructure will not be thrilled at the idea of yet another collaboration and storage location, yet another cloud subscription, and yet another set of DPAs. That's even _if_ they are open to the idea of storing data in the cloud in the first place.

### draw.io keeps your data in your infrastructure

If you aren't already using Confluence Cloud, you most likely you want to keep all of your data within your infrastructure, behind your firewall. That's why you are using Server or Data Center products, after all.

The draw.io apps for Confluence and Jira Server let you collaborate and keep your data in your infrastructure. Even when a diagram is being edited, the _diagram data is only stored in your employee's browser_ and in the attachment in Confluence or on your Jira issue.
