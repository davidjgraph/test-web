Plugins extend the functionality of diagrams.net. These plugins may not be production quality as some are developmental code, and therefore should be used as-is.

[See a list of all of the available plugins](/doc/faq/plugins.html)

You can easily uninstall a plugin if you no longer need it.

1. Click _Extras > Plugins_ to see the list of plugins you have currently loaded.
