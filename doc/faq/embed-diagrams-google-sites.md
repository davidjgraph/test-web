It's easy to embed diagrams into both the new and the classic version of Google Sites.


## Embed a diagram in the new Google Sites

The current version of Google Sites allows you to edit the HTML of your web pages. That makes it easy to embed a draw.io diagram as HTML.

1. In the draw.io editor, select _File > Embed > HTML_ to open the HTML options dialog.

7. You can resize your diagram in the Google Sites editor just like a normal image - grab and drag the square handles around the edge of your selected diagram. When you are finished formatting and adding content to your page, click _Publish_.

## Embed a diagram in the classic Google sites

If you are using the classic version of Google sites, you will need to embed an IFrame.

1. Click _File > Embed > IFrame_ to open the IFrame options dialog.

2. Set the options you want to use within the IFrame and click _Create_.

4. Edit a web page in your classic Google Site. Click on the ``<HTML>`` tool in the toolbar above the editor.

5. Paste the HTML code that contains the IFrame into the _HTML_ tab of the _Google Sites, Edit HTML_ dialog and click _Update_.

6. The classic Google Sites editor will show you that a Google Gadget containing an IFrame has been added to the page. Unfortunately, you won't be able to see a preview of the diagram until you save the page. Click _Save_ in the top right above the editor to publish your page.
7. Now, your diagram will be displayed in your classic Google Site using the diagram lightbox (if you used the default options when generating the IFrame HTML code).
